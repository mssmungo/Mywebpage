In this tutorial on which we will be focussing on how to make an off shoulder blouse, we are going to take it step by step from taking measurement to the cutting and stitching, but firstly let us look at some various aspect of what we will need to make our off-shoulder blouse.


A blouse is a clothe usually made between the shoulder and the lower waist, the material it is being made of, that gives it that look in which you can easily recognize it as a blouse is one thing that is very unique about a blouse. It usually have a v neck, a rectangular neck or a circle neck, with a zipper at the back or side of it which make it a little bit tight-fitted in the body.

We have off shoulder with sleeve and another without sleeve and can have other segmented part such as the dart, the corset or breast tube, flare etc, and there are some attributed material which can also be applied in some certain part of this blouse such as using linen, paper gum, hairstain, breast tube thickener all this are some of the things put together to make a perfect blouse and no doubt some of them can be exempted while making the clothe depending on the preference of the customer you are making the clothe for, they may not like you to use corset or breast tube, they would rather want you to sew it simple for them without too many design, they can equally tell you to make it sleeveless or include sleeve but if you are not sewing the clothe for a customer then you will decide the kind of Pattern you will use by yourself.

As you know from the basic tutorial, clothe are named according to the pattern in which they are being made, some top-wears clothes can be short or long, they can even be as short as being above the waist of the body like a crop top and can be long as long as getting to the ankle of the body like a kimono, bubu dress, jalabyia, etc, but in the case of blouse, it is usually between the shoulder and the lower waist ("the lower waist", that is, the region of the body between the waist and the hip). The blouse can be drafted without dividing the clothe into too many sub-segment, like including, breast tube segment or flare segment.

Scissors, taperule, chalk or marker, helming gum, needle. Pin, curve ruler, sewing machine, cardboard papar, weaving and embroidery machine.
These are some of the equipment you will need which will make the work easy for you as some certain part of the cloth will need you to apply any of the tools specifically. You might find some area hard to work on, if you don't know the right equipment to use.

To make your off-shoulder blouse here are what you need and all you need to do

Tools and Materials Needed

*Chooose the right fabric material for the blouse 

*Cotton: Perfect for beginners due to its ease of handling. It's also quite breathable, making it a good choice for summer wear.
*Satin or Silk. If you're aiming for an elegant look, these fabrics are your go-to. Keep in mind, though, they can be slippery and a bit more challenging to sew.
*Linen: Offers a rustic charm and is quite forgiving for those less-than-perfect seams.
 Fabric (2-3 yards should do the trick)
* Matching thread
* Sewing machine (a basic one will work just fine)
* Scissors, pins, tape measure, chalk or fabric marker
* Elastic band (for the shoulder and arm areas)
* Pattern (you can find free patterns online or draft your own based on a blouse that fits you well)

Preparing the Fabric

Remember to wash and iron your fabric. This step might seem skippable, but it's crucial for preventing any shrinkage after your first post-creation wash.

Draft and Cut Your clothe
After laying your fabric flat, use your chalk or fabric marker to outline your pieces based on the pattern you've chosen or created. This is the moment for precision, so take your time. You'll typically need to cut out a front and back piece, and possibly sleeves, depending on the design you're going for.

Sewing the Pieces Together

Alright, this is where the fun really begins. Start by pinning the front and back pieces right sides together. Sew the sides and, if you're including them, attach the sleeves. For the off-shoulder elastic casing, fold the top edge over and sew, leaving a small opening to thread your elastic through later.

Adding the Elastic

Measure the elastic against your shoulders to find a comfortable fit. Thread it through the casing you've created, sew the ends together, then sew the casing shut. Repeat a similar process for the sleeves if they're included in your design.

The Finishing

Once your blouse is assembled and the elastic is in place, try it on. This is the moment of truth! Make any necessary adjustments to ensure a perfect fit. Finally, hem the bottom and any raw edges to keep things neat and tidy.

Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just created your very own off shoulder blouse. Not only have you made a fashionable garment, but you've also taken an important step in your sewing journey. Wear your new creation with pride, and remember, the beauty of sewing is not just in the final product but in the creativity, mistakes, and lessons learned along the way.</body>
